__There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.__



__Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data worldâ€¦so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!__



__The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.__



__This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!__
